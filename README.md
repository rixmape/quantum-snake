# Quantum Snake Game

## Description

Quantum Snake is an innovative take on the classic snake game, incorporating elements of quantum mechanics to create a unique and engaging gameplay experience. In this browser-based game, players control a snake that exists in a state of quantum superposition, adding an exciting twist to the traditional snake game mechanics.

## Key Features

- Classic snake gameplay with a quantum twist
- Quantum superposition mechanic for the snake's head
- Increasing difficulty as the snake grows
- Score tracking with local storage for high scores
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Canvas API for rendering

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```plaintext
   git clone https://github.com/rixmape/quantum-snake.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```plaintext
   cd quantum-snake
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.

No additional installation or build steps are required as this is a client-side only application.

## Usage

- Open the game in a web browser
- Click the "Start Game" button to begin
- Use arrow keys to control the snake's direction
- Press the spacebar to collapse the quantum superposition

## Game Controls

- ↑ (Up Arrow): Move up
- ↓ (Down Arrow): Move down
- ← (Left Arrow): Move left
- → (Right Arrow): Move right
- Spacebar: Collapse quantum superposition

## Game Rules

1. Guide the snake to eat food particles to grow and score points
2. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body
3. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself
4. The snake's head exists in a quantum superposition of two possible positions
5. Collapsing the superposition at the right moment can help avoid collisions or reach food

## Quantum Mechanic

The quantum aspect of the game is represented by the snake's head existing in a superposition of two possible next positions. This superposition collapses either randomly or when the player presses the spacebar, determining the actual position of the snake's head. Strategic use of this mechanic can allow players to navigate tight spaces or reach food that would be impossible in a classical snake game.
